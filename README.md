### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<a class="btn text-neutral-100 bg-primary-900 fs-btn" href="#">Sign In</a>
```

```html
<button class="cta | text-neutral-100 bg-primary-900 fs-cta">
  Get Started<span class="cta-icon"
    ><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i
  ></span>
</button>
```

```html
<video
  src="./images/1.m4v"
  autoplay
  playisinline
  muted
  loop
  type="video/mp4"
></video>
```

```css
@media (min-width: 950px) {
  :root {
    --fs-cta: var(--fs-700);
    --fs-primary-heading: var(--fs-xl);
    --fs-qns: var(--fs-700);
    --fs-form-title: var(--fs-500);
  }
}
```

```css
.even-column-reverse {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
  justify-content: space-between;
  gap: 1rem;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: left;
}
```

```css
.question {
  min-width: clamp(645px, 815px, 100%);
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
